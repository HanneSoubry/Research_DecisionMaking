# Research_DecisionMaking
 Here you can find my project to research and compare decision making techniques Binary Tree, Utility AI and Goal Oriented Action Planning for my thesis.

 It includes a small batlle game and 4 AI behaviours, one test behaviour that makes random moves and the 3 decision making techniques mentioned above.
 In the folder MatchResults, you can find the excel sheet ResultAnalysis where I wrote down the results of the battles. You can of course also open the project and run the battles yourself.
